''' Lesson 11 The PWM value as it increases creates maximum brightness at a very low value , WE WOULD RATHER increement slowly and be able to perseive the changes. To do this we will change the scale from 0 to 65535 to 0-16.
The two points are (0,0) & (65535, 0) and Find the slope m=
If we read 65536 , we want to turn that into 16

1.	can make as many increments as desired. Let's choose 50 increments.

2.	brightness = constant to the 50th power. b=c**(1/50)
3.	How do we get the constant. We have to solve for the constant.
    65535**(1/50) =[c**50]**(1/50)
    this gives  65535**(1/50) = c
